# Aircraft-Analysis 
# Overview 
This project was made to show a company expanding their business to the aviation industry, with the intention of finding an aircraft model that can perform safely and efficiently for international travel 
# Business Problems
The company needs an aircraft that can withstand the elements, can fly internationally, and has a very minimal accidental history. 
# Data
All the data I used for this project is from the National Transportation Safety Board. The data from their website includes make, models, weather reports, accident history, and much more

These Graphs display the safest aircraft models with the lowest accident history. One displays lowest accidents due to visibility and weather, and the other is a more general accident history. 
# Conclusion
Finding the perfect aircraft is not an easy task, however I have narrowed it down to the safest ones. Factoring in weather and overall accidental history any of the aircraft shown would be a perfect addition to growing business looking to expand into the aviation industry
